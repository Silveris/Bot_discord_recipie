Put pot on the stove and bring it to a simmer to pull impurities out of the meat. Skim the gray foamy layer of impurities off the top of the water, drain the water out, and scrub the bones and meat clean.Place clean bones and meat into the empty clean stockpot, adding your choice of aromatics. I used a little handful of licorice root, a healthy-sized chunk of cassia bark (aka Chinese cinnamon or just cinnamon), a few pieces of dried tangerine peel, a handful of dried longan fruit, a handful of dried star anise pods, a whole onion quartered, a handful of fresh ginger freshly peeled, and two carrots. I also threw in 4 dried Chinese scallops, which are expensive but are a huge umami booster. Cover with cold water and put it on the stove, bringing the pot to a bare simmer. At the beginning of the boil, skim off any scum. Keep it on the stove slow and low for 4-12 hours, just barely bubbling so the broth stays clear. Once flavors and colors are nice and deep, strain cool in an ice bath and refrigerate overnight.Hand Pulled NoodlesCombine the four elements of hand-pulled noodles: 500g of bread flour, 306g of water, 5g of salt, and 4g of a mix of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (Note: there are countless ratios that can vary based on a number of factors such as altitude.

This process can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours until the dough resembles chewing gum texture. Pounding the dough against the table as you stretch also helps. Keep the dough hydrated by patting it down and brushing with water every 4-6 tugs. It should be between a very hydrated bread dough and pasta dough. Alternatively, laminate and flatten the dough until it becomes supple enough to pass through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter.Cut the dough in half to make it easier to work with, keeping the other half covered with plastic. Stretch and give the dough a few slaps on the tabletop to prevent tearing. Give it an even roll, then evenly dust with flour to prevent sticking. It should look like a rope. Fold, stretch, and repeat until noodles form. Alternatively, stretch out each noodle one at a time, resulting in flatter and less uniform noodles. I recommend just putting the dough through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter if you are ever going to try to make these noodles at home.Homemade Chili OilIn a small saucepan, throw a handful of Szechuan peppercorns, star anise pods, cassia bark, a knob of peeled ginger, and 3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic. Pour 2-3 cups of canola oil over the top and gently swirl over medium heat until the oil reaches about 325°F. Strain and pour over about a cup of Sichuan chili flakes into a heat-proof bowl.

Meanwhile, cover a single crepe with scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, and gruyere cheese. Take the taco out of the oven, remove the corn husk, and wrap inside the crepe. Place the crepe-taco onto the meat lovers pizza, wrap it around the taco, and finish by wrapping the blueberry pancake around the pizza. Press together as tightly as possible without breaking any of the layers. Secure with long wooden skewers, and using a wide casserole filled with some beer batter, cover the entire taco in batter. Using extreme caution, place the battered taco in the hot oil, basting with a metal ladle if not completely covered by the oil. Fry for 10 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy all over. Remove from the oil and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Fill a canvas bag with vegetarian chili, and place the taco inside. Enjoy?']},\n",
